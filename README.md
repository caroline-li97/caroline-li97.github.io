# Zhiheng Li's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, which is a customized version of the Github Pages template by Sen Li.

The template is built using Bootstrap and integrates Markdown files as content input, allowing for easy and automatic parsing of the content for the website. I've modified it to reflect my own academic and professional background, with sections for my projects, skills, and research interests.

## Features
- Machine learning project showcasing a malware classification model.
- Full-stack development with Ruby on Rails and React for building web applications.
- Personal bio, project showcase, and contact information.
